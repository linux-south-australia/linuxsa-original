<H2>What is IP masquerading and when is it of use?</H2>

<P>IP masquerading is a process where one computer acts as an IP
gateway for a network.&nbsp; All computers on the network send their
IP packets through the gateway, which replaces the source IP address
with its own address and then forwards it to the internet.&nbsp;
Perhaps the source IP port number is also replaced with another port
number, although that is less interesting.&nbsp; All hosts on the
internet see the packet as originating from the gateway.</P>

<P>Any host on the Internet which wishes to send a packet back, ie in
reply, must necessarily address that packet to the gateway.&nbsp;
Remember that the gateway is the only host seen on the internet.&nbsp;
The gateway rewrites the destination address, replacing its own
address with the IP address of the machine which is being masqueraded,
and forwards that packet on to the local network for delivery.</P>

<P>This procedure sounds simple, and it is.&nbsp; It provides an
effective means by which you can provide second class internet
connections for a complete LAN using only one (internet) IP
address.&nbsp; Note the essential phrase, ``second class internet
connections''.</P>

<P>IP masquerading cannot provide full internet connections to the
hosts which hide behind it.&nbsp; The reason for this is that any
connection can be established outwards, that is a hidden host can
connect to any service which is "advertised" on the internet, but no
connection can be established inwards.&nbsp; No host which is hidden
behind the gateway will ever receive a connection for a port which it
listens to.&nbsp; This precludes hidden hosts from offering services
such as Telnet, file transfer, www, mail, news and so on.</P>

<P>The reason why no inward connection will ever be established is
that the process of listening on a port produces no packet.&nbsp; When
a program listens it does not annouce that it is listening, it just
listens.&nbsp; When a host wishes to connect to a service it has no
way of knowing if that connection can possibly succeed; it simply
sends a connection packet to the destination IP address.  If there no
host at that destination address, the host trying to connect
eventually times out and reports the connection failed.&nbsp; If there
is a host at that destination address, but it is not listening at that
port, the destination host returns a connection refused message and
the host trying to connect immediately reports the connection
failed.</P>

<P>Remember that the only IP address visible on the internet, with
respect to a masqueraded LAN, is the gateway's address.&nbsp; Any
inbound connection must be addressed to the gateway's address.&nbsp;
With no prior communication between the hidden host and the gateway,
there is nothing to indicate (to the gateway) how to rewrite the
destination address for local delivery.</P>

<P>The conclusion of all of this is that if your program works by
listening at an address (I suspect ICQ does this) so that other hosts
on the internet can connect to you, that program will be of no use to
you if your connection is through a masquerading gateway.</P>
