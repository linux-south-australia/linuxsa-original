IO Redirection</H1>

<!--#include virtual="/buttonbar.txt"-->

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P>UNIX had the concept of IO redirection long before DOS copied and
bastardised the concept.  The UNIX IO redirection concept is
fundamental to many of the things that you can do with UNIX, and it is
quite a well-developed idea, so we will explore this concept here.</P>

<P>Why do I mention UNIX at all?  Well, Linux <EM>is</EM> a UNIX
operating system!</P>

<P>Under UNIX, all programs that run are given three open files when
they are started by a shell:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>0.</TD><TD><P><STRONG>Standard in, or
STDIN.</STRONG></P>

<P>This is where input comes from, and it normally points at your
terminal device.</P>

<P>To find out what device is your terminal, use the
<CODE>tty(1)</CODE> command.  Note, the <CODE>(1)</CODE> after command
names in UNIX refers to the section of the man pages that the
documentation for the command exists in.

<P>You can arrange to run any command and pass it input from a file in
the following way:</P>

<PRE>
$ some-command < /path/to/some/file
</PRE>

<P>Note, the '<CODE>$</CODE>' is your prompt.  Note also, you can
always specify a complete path name for a file.</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE>
$ grep -i Fred < /etc/passwd
</PRE>

<P>Would search for the string 'fred' in /etc/passwd, regardless of
the case of the characters.</P>

<P>But wait a minute, you object, I always use:</P>

<PRE>
$ grep -i Fred /etc/passwd
</PRE>

<P>This is true, but you can also pass the file in on STDIN, and you
will get different results if you do.  Can you see what the difference
is?</P>

</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>1.</TD><TD><P><STRONG>Standard out, or
STDOUT.</STRONG></P>

<P>This is where the normal output from a program goes.  It normally
points at your terminal as well, but you can redirect it.</P>

<P>You can redirect output in the following way:</P>

<PRE>
$ some-program > /path/to/some/file
</PRE>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE>
$ grep -i Fred /etc/passwd > /tmp/results
</PRE>

</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>2.</TD><TD><P><STRONG>Standard error, or
STDERR.</STRONG></P>

<P>This is where error output from your program goes.  This normally
points at your terminal as well, but you can redirect it.</P>

<P>Why have different output places for standard out and standard
error?</P>

<P>Well, as you will see when you come to writing shell scripts, you
often do not want error messages cluttering up the normal output from
a program.</P>

</TR></TD></TABLE>

<P>You will forgive me for starting the above list at 0, I am sure,
when you learn that each of these IO 'channels' are represented by
small numbers, called file descripters (FDs), that have exactly those
numbers.  That is, STDIN is FD&nbsp;0, while STDOUT is FD&nbsp;1, and
STDERR is FD&nbsp;2.</P>

<P>When the shell runs a program for you, it opens STDIN as FD&nbsp;0,
STDOUT as FD&nbsp;1, and STDERR as FD&nbsp;2, and then runs the
program (technically, it almost always does a <CODE>fork(2)</CODE> and
then an <CODE>exec(3)</CODE> or one of the exec?? calls).  If you have
redirected one of STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR, your shell opens that file
as the appropriate FD before running the program.</P>

<P>Now, what does this all have to do with you, I hear you ask?</P>

<P>Well, there are lots of neat things you can do, but some things to
watch out for as well.</P>

<P>A lot of inexperienced UNIX users assume that they can redirect a
file into a program and use the same name for redirecting the
output:</P>

<PRE>
$ some-program < mega-important-data-file > mega-important-data-file
</PRE>

<P>They become very upset after doing the above, especially if that
mega-important data file has never been backed up anywhere.  Why is
this?</P>

<P>The shell opens the mega-important-data-file for reading and
associates it with FD&nbsp;0 (or STDIN), and then opens it for
writing, but truncates it to zero length, and associates it with
FD&nbsp;1 (or STDOUT) as well.</P>

<P>So, if you want to do something like the above, use a different
file name for the output file.  Oh, you should also back up files as
well :-).</P>

<P>Now, there are lots of redirection symbols that you can use, and
here are some of them:</P>

<TABLE>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>&lt; <I>file</I></TD>
<TD>means open a file for reading and associate with STDIN.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>&lt;&lt; <I>token</I></TD>
<TD>Means use the current input stream as STDIN for the program until
<I>token</I> is seen.  We will ignore this one until we get to
scripting.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>&gt; <I>file</I></TD>
<TD>means open a file for writing and truncate it and associate it
with STDOUT.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>&gt;&gt; <I>file</I></TD>
<TD>means open a file for writing and seek to the end and associate it
with STDOUT.  This is how you append to a file using a redirect.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><I>n</I>&gt;&amp;<I>m</I></TD>
<TD>means redirect FD <I>n</I> to the same places as FD <I>m</I>. Eg,
<CODE>2&gt;&1</CODE> means send STDERR to the same place that STDOUT
is going to.</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>OK, here are some tricks that you might want to use in various
places.</P>

<P>If you are gathering evidence for a bug report, you might want to
redirect the output from a series of programs to a text file (never
mind that you can use the script command to do the same :-).  So you
might do the following:</P>

<PRE>
$ some-buggy-program &gt; important-evidence.txt
$ echo '---------MARKER-------' &gt;&gt; important-evidence.txt
$ some-buggy-program <I>some-params</I> &gt;&gt; important-evidence.txt
</PRE>

<P>The second and subsequent lines append the output from the commands
issues to the evidence file rather than overwriting them.  Try the
following:</P>

<PRE>
$ echo This is a line of text &gt; /tmp/file.txt
$ echo This is another line   &gt; /tmp/file.txt
</PRE>

<P>What do you get?</P>

<P>Now try:</P>

<PRE>
$ echo This is a line of text &gt; /tmp/file.txt
$ echo This is another line   &gt;&gt; /tmp/file.txt
</PRE>

<P>What do you get this time?</P>

<P>OK, for the last few tricks here.  Sometimes you want to append
STDOUT and STDERR to a file.  How do you do it?</P>

<PRE>
$ some-command &gt;&gt; /tmp/log.log 2&gt;&1
</PRE>

<P>The <CODE>2&gt;&1</CODE> says make STDERR point to the same places
as STDOUT.  Since STDOUT is open already, and the shell has done a
seek to the end, STDERR will also be appended to STDOUT.</P>

<P>If you want to append a line to a file, you can echo the line you
want with a redirect, rather than firing up an editor:</P>

<PRE>
$ echo <I>Some text</I> &gt;&gt; /path/to/some/file
</PRE>

<P>It turns out that you can cause the shell to redirect to other file
descriptors as well, and if you look in the configure scripts that
come with many UNIX software packages, you will see examples of
this.</P>

<P>Why is redirecting so important?  Well, it is used in many shell
scripts, it is a simple and conventient mechanism to sending output to
any file without the programmer having to add code for handling
command line instructions, and it is the UNIX way of doing things
:-).</P>

<P>It is also the same as piping, where you redirect output to, or
input from, a pipe device.  The pipe device has a process living on
the other side, but we will look at this later.</P>

<P>Regards</P>
