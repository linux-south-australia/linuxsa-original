<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>I have seen a lot of people who are new to Linux who are aware of
the poor scripting tools and command line tools that Windows has;
these same people bring the same attitudes to Linux.</P>

<H2>Command Line Tricks</H2>

<P>The default shell under Linux, bash (the Bourne Again Shell, an old
UNIX joke), has a number of very useful facilities.</P>

<UL>

<LI><P><STRONG>command and file name completion.</STRONG></P>

<P>You do not have to slavishly type in the whole of a command's name
or the whole of a file's name if it is an argument to a command.  bash
can complete these things for you if what you have already typed in is
unambiguous.</P>

<P>Try for example: <CODE>mor</CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</P>

<P>That is hit the tab key after tying in '<CODE>mor</CODE>'</P>

<P>Under most circumstances, bash will complete it to '<CODE>more
</CODE>' for you, and wait for you to type in a file name.</P>

<P>Next, try: <CODE>mo</CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</P>

<P>In this case, nothing happens, except that bash may beep at you.
Here, what you have typed is ambiguous, so bash can't complete it.</P>

<P>To see what commands are available, hit the tab key twice in
succession.  bash will display all the possibilities, and you can
usually enter one or two more characters and hit tab again, and bash
will complete the command for you.</P>

<P>The same is true for file names as arguments.</P>

<LI><P><STRONG>bash is a veritable programming language that has
variables, programming statements and so forth.</STRONG></P>

<P>The DOS command prompt is crap by comparison.</P>

<P>Let us say that you are downloading a file, something that many of
us do frequently, I think.  You want to do something else after the
download is finished, and you want to watch it in a window while you
do other things in other windows.</P>

<P>Instead of manually entering an '<CODE>ls -al</CODE> &lt;file&gt;'
in a window every now and then, here is an approach that will
automatically show you how far the download has got every minute.</P>

<P>
<PRE>
   while [ 1 ]
   do
      ls -al &lt;file&gt; ; sleep 60
   done
</PRE>
</P>

<P>What this does is loop forever (<CODE>while [ 1 ]</CODE> says while
true do etc)</P>

<P>Then do an '<CODE>ls -al</CODE>' of the file. You will have to
specify the file name and path.  Then the semicolon allows me to put
two commands on the one line.</P>

<P>Then we sleep for 60 seconds, and then complete the loop.</P>

<P>Try it with other commands.  You can use it with</P>

<PRE>
      ps -ax | grep &lt;some proc&gt;
</PRE>

<P>to check that a process is still running and so on ...</P>

<P>When you are finished, use ^C (That is control-C) to kill the
loop.</P>

<P>Then recall the command (with the up-arrow key) and see what bash
has recorded it as.  See all those extra semicolons there?  That is
how you enter the above loop all on the one line ...</P>

</UL>

<P>Of course, if you want to get a file and then do something after,
you could use wget to get the file and simply enter another command
after a semicolon of something like that.</P>

<P>Next posting, someone will explain STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR, along
with talking about what is going on with piping commands together.
Then we will get to bash variables, and more complex loops.</P>

<P>In the spirit of contribution,</P>

<P>Hope this helps ...</P>

<P>Regards</P>
