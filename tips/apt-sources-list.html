apt/sources.list and Debian Versions</H1>

<HR WIDTH="50%">

<P><I>Translated from an email that Paul sent to the LinuxSA list
15/Sep/2004.</I></P>

<P>This was meant to be a small point of correction.. but it got a
little out of hand.</P>

<P>The format of the /etc/apt/sources.list is:</P>

<PRE>
deb &lt;BASE_URL&gt; &lt;DISTRIBUTION&gt; &lt;SECTION&gt; [&lt;SECTION&gt;*]
deb-src &lt;BASE_URL&gt; &lt;DISTRIBUTION&gt; &lt;SECTION&gt; [&lt;SECTION&gt;*]
</PRE>

<P>Where <TT>BASE_URL</TT> is something like:</P>

<PRE>
http://ftp.au.debian.org
</PRE>

<P>The DISTRIBUTION may be one of</P>

<DL>

<DT>stable</DT>

<DD>never changes unless absolutely necessary. There is a separate
repository for security updates. Which is a separate entry in
'<TT>sources.list</TT>'. This is the distribution you would use for
'servers' that cannot EVER have any downtime. Designed to allow
sysadmins to sleep at night. As a result, it is getting reasonably
old.</DD>

<DT>unstable</DT>

<DD>current Debian development bleeding edge distribution. You should
expect both code bugs and packaging issues, if you use this
distribution.  On the plus side, any problems found will be fixed here
first, and there are some package sanity checks.</DD>

<DT>testing</DT>

<DD>After a package has been in the 'unstable' distribution for a
period (10 days I think) and no bugs have been raised against it, it
migrates to the 'testing' distribution. This is a good distribution to
use, for those who don't want cutting edge, but would like to use
Gnome 2.6 for example.</DD>

</DL>

<P>There are 'core' packages that make up a distribution and are only
changed if '<TT>apt-get dist-upgrade</TT>' or equivalent command is
used. These includes the software that maintains the packaging system
itself.</P>

<P>The distributions can also be referred to by their names. This is
less useful as a Debian release essentially involves renaming
'unstable/testing' to 'stable' and recreating 'unstable' and starting
a new development cycle. So the next stable release (CD's etc.) will
be Sarge... and I'm expecting to see this before the end of the year..
(ever hopeful).</P>

<DL>

<DT>woody</DT>

<DD>currently another name for stable</DD>

<DT>sarge</DT>

<DD>currently another name for unstable</DD>

<DT>sid</DT>

<DD>a half baked experimental distribution, given the the name
because of the kid next door that pulled toys apart. The names come
from Toy Story...</DD>

</DL>

<P>But back to '<TT>/etc/apt/sources.list</TT>'. The section can be
one of:</P>

<DL>

<DT>main</DT>

<DT>contrib</DT>

<DD>free packages that have non-free dependancies</DD>

<DT>non-free</DT>

<DD>as in free speech not free beer</DD>

</DL>

<P>The purpose of these is described on the Debian Documentation
pages, but all of packages that you would normally need would be in
'main'. You can put multiple sections onto the end of the same line,
and if you are creating your own Debian repository, you can create
your own sections.</P>

<P>All these are put together to form a URL that 'apt' uses to recover
the packages that you're after.</P>

<UL>

<LI>'<TT>dists</TT>' is placed after the BASE_URL, before the
DISTRIBUTION

<LI>'<TT>binary-i386</TT>' is placed after the SECTION

</UL>

<P>So the full URL becomes something like:</P>

<PRE>
http://ftp.debian.org/dists/testing/main/binary-i386/
</PRE>

<P>This used to be used to get both the package listing (with
'<TT>apt-get update</TT>') and the packages themselves.  These days,
it usually only contains the package listing which then refers to the
package pool, where all the packages are kept..</P>

<PRE>
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/
</PRE>

<P>The '<TT>packages</TT>' file lists the file location as something
like</P>

<PRE>
pool/main/3/3dchess/3dchess_0.8.1-11_i386.deb
</PRE>

<P>which is applied the the base URL, to find the location of the
file. You can browse the Debian repository by going directly to these
URL's.</P>

<P>NOTE: Do not be tempted to mix 'stable', 'testing' and 'unstable'
sources.list entries without reading some more about 'pinning'.
