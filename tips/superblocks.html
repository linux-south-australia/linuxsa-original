<P>Some disk blocks are quite boring.&nbsp; Some are marginally
interesting.&nbsp; A very few are just super.&nbsp; :-)</P>

<P>The original Unix filesystem was composed of four sections: Boot
blocks, which contain the secondary stage bootstrap loader; a super
block, which I will describe in a minute; the i-node table, which
contains i-nodes, and i-nodes are the complete file except for the
data; and data plus indirect blocks.</P>

<P>I-nodes are, as I said, are the complete file except for the
data.&nbsp; That is, they describe who owns the file, when it was last
accessed and modified, what the permissions are for the file, and the
list of blocks which contain the data.&nbsp; Side note: Unix files
don't have names.&nbsp; They have (i-node) numbers.&nbsp; Directories
are files which contain a number of filename, i-node number pairs;
called links.</P>

<P>Data blocks contain the file data.&nbsp; Since i-nodes are of fixed
size, obviously there is an upper limit to the number of data blocks
which can be listed in the inode.&nbsp; When an inode can no longer
contain the list of data blocks, that list is moved to an indirect
block, and the i-node is converted to contain a list of indirect
blocks.&nbsp; When the inode can no longer contain a list of indirect
blocks, the list is moved to a double-indirect block and the inode
then contains a list of double-indirect blocks.&nbsp; I notice
(<TT>/usr/include/linux/sysv_fs.h</TT>) that ``traditional''
filesystems now allow triple-indirect blocks, which just goes to show
that even tradition is hard to keep up with.</P>

<P>The super block describes the size of the inode-table and the size
of the total file system.&nbsp; It also contains a list of some
recently freed data blocks, which is used to quickly find a free block
when you want to allocate a new one.&nbsp; Similarly there is a
(partial) list of free inodes.</P>

<P>I made the point that files don't have names, they have numbers,
and that directories provide a map between names and numbers.&nbsp; So
how do you find the root of a filesystem?&nbsp; The answer is that it
is inode number two.&nbsp; Inode 1 contains a list of bad blocks on
the disk.</P>

<P>One of the less desirable features of the traditional filesystem is
that it has only one superblock, and if you lose that you are really
stuffed.&nbsp; Look: You wouldn't even know where the inode table
ended and the data table started.&nbsp; As a remedy to that, when the
BSD Fast File System was designed, it was given backup copies of the
superblock.&nbsp; So if you lost the main superblock you could mount
using one of the backup copies (but you had to know where it was (but
it's not to hard to find it)).</P>

<P>Now don't you agree that from a filesystem perspective, data blocks
are only marginally interesting, but that first block is just
super?&nbsp; ;-)</P>
