<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>State Supply (Procurement of Software) Amendment Bill 2003</H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Draft Second Reading Speech</H2>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Hon Ian Gilfillan MLC</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>(Check against Delivery)</B></P>

<P>Mr President, despite the onerous title, this Bill is about
the use of Open Source Software by the Government of South Australia.</P>

<P>Open Source software is an unusual concept and one that will
take more than the usual amount of explanation.</P>

<H2>Ordinary Products</H2>
<P>When we buy something, we usually buy the right to use that
thing in any way that we see fit.  For example, if you buy a car, you can add
roof racks or a tow bar or even paint the car a different colour.  </P>

<P>The key thing about buying something is that it becomes your
property and you can do with it as you will, even to the point of selling it
on to someone else.  You could even break up a car into pieces and sell the
pieces to different people.</P>

<H2>Software</H2>
<P>Somehow we have been tricked into believing that software is a
different kind of thing, and many have accepted the idea that we don't own a
piece of software once we buy it.  In fact, some of the major suppliers of
software have moved to a revenue model whereby it's necessary to continually
pay rent for the right to use a product that has been purchased.</P>

<P>Even stranger, we aren't even allowed to see the workings of
the software so that we can check to make sure that it is doing what we expect
or want it to do.  If I continue with the car example, this would be
equivalent to buying a car, but never being allowed to look under the bonnet
to see what is inside.</P>

<P>This is a very strange situation, where people are paying
astonishingly large amounts of money on an ongoing basis, for very few rights.</P>

<P>In many cases, people are not even allowed to talk about their
experiences with using a piece of software, because of the narrow terms of the
license agreement that comes with that software.</P>

<H2>The Open Source Movement</H2>
<P>In response to this and many other problems in the computer
software industry, a world-wide movement of people have developed a set of
competing software products that don't have restrictive license agreements. 
In fact, the most common clause associated with Open Source software is that
you can use the software in any way, and modify it as you see fit, provided
you include a full copy of the source code every time you sell the software to
another party.</P>

<P>As the source code of this software is available for anyone to
see at any time, this code is robust and secure.  </P>

<H2>South Australia</H2>
<P>Mr President, this Open Source Software movement is a vast
opportunity for South Australia.</P>

<P>Our universities could be teaching computer science around
Open Source products, allowing students to examine in intimate detail, the
workings of established products.  Every student assignment has the potential
to contribute to the body of functioning open source systems.  Simply by
forwarding their completed work to the relevant Open Source project, their
code could become part of a greater work in publication.</P>

<P>It is worth noting, Mr President, that some of the most widely
used and recognized pieces of Open Source software have been developed here in
Australia.  As an example, the Samba project, which allows Linux computers to
seamlessly integrate with Windows networks, was developed by a team that was
primarily based in Canberra.</P>

<P>Because the Open Source paradigm uses a different business
model, it is possible for student computers to be fully programmed with
Operating Systems, Development Tools, and working Applications Software at <B>no
cost to the student</B>, as a lot of Open Source Software is also free software.</P>

<P>This factor alone has the potential to save the education
sector millions of dollars in license fees.</P>

<P>South Australia's IT industry is ideally placed to develop and
maintain Open Source systems.  Every government development project could
leverage the efforts of previous projects by standing on the shoulders of the
work that has been done before.  Open Source code is inherently portable, and
can be compiled to run on any computer architecture, or be customized to suit
any Department's specific needs.  Thus work developed for one Agency, can
easily be carried over to another under this paradigm.</P>

<P>I hasten to point out Mr President, that some international IT
houses that develop work here in South Australia, DMR (a division of Fujitsu)
for example already make it their standard practice to supply source code with
any delivered product.  Changing the licensing conditions to make these
products open source, would not be a significant imposition on businesses that
operate in this fashion.</P>

<P>Where this would be significant, is in the enormous amounts of
money that is currently being channeled into the hands of a few very large
American companies.  </P>

<P>It is common in the computer industry to hear frustrated IT
specialists talking about the Microsoft Tax, the extra charge that is paid to
Microsoft every time a computer is purchased, no matter how that computer is
being used.</P>

<P>If we develop software locally under the Open Source paradigm,
we allow our IT specialists to make quality products that they can sell to the
wider world, along with support and training for their customers.</P>

<P>By encouraging our Departments and Agencies to use Open Source
Software, we support a local development environment that can open the door to
international sales.</P>

<P>Bear in mind that South Australia already has a history of
developing IT products that are sold overseas, so this Bill is seeding already
fertile ground.</P>

<P>Mr President, this Bill is a simple one, and yet, it has the
potential to do great things for our state.  It requires procurement people in
public authorities to consider the alternative of using open source software,
and wherever practicable, using open source in preference to proprietary software.</P>

<P>Mr President, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
