Clustering for Beginners
March 18th, 2003

A joint presentation sponsored by Apple Australia (SA Office) and
Tellurian Pty Ltd, presented by:
- Jennifer Walbank, Apple Engineer
- John Brazel, Tellurian Software Engineer
- Dan Shearer, Tellurian

While it might sound like "Building your own nuclear power station at
home", this presentation explains how ordinary systems administration
skills are all that are required in order to build and run a useful,
heterogenous cluster using open source software.

There will be a mixture of Apple and other hardware used, with a
distributed graphics demonstration to illustrate how one type of
compute clustering works. The discussion will rapidly mention all
sorts of open source clustering before focussing on things relevant to
the demonstration for the evening. This is "Open Source Clustering
Basics", not "El Guru Clustering for 4th Yr Computational Dynamics",
but there should be new things for El Gurus too -- and certainly the
opportunity to contribute to discussion.
