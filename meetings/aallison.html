<P>Andrew will be presenting an overview of uses of Linux in
Scientific Computing.  His presentation will include what is out there
on the Internet, and he will show how scientific data can be processed
in the Linux environment with examples in the Economic and Electronic
domains.  He will use samples of commercially available numerical
libraries that allow easy implementation of scientific principles.
Andrew will also present other packages that allow mathematical and
electronic analysis of data.</P>

<P>Andrew has worked at the CSIRO and Telstra.  His areas of
experience include numerical analysis, telephony, business data
processing, computer networks and cable television.  He is married
with one daughter, and in his spare time he enjoys music performance,
computer programming, bushwalking and photography.</P>

<P>Over the last seven years Linux has become an important operating
system within the commercial marketplace.  No longer a hackers system,
in terms of features, stability, speed and verified volume shipments
Linux is one of the leading certified UNIX implementations.  Linux is
one of the few truly open systems on the market today, being able to
be run on a huge range of hardware, running software written for many
other operating systems, and integrating into most kinds of
networks.</P>

<P>LinuxSA is a Linux Support Group based in South Australia.
LinuxSA's primary roles are to act as a local point of contact for
Linux to people and companies in South Australia, to offer a basic
Support Infrastructure for people and companies using Linux and
finally give people and companies an insight into how Linux can be
used in the Real World.  LinuxSA is associated with no company,
charges no fees, and generates no revenue.  It is a purely volunteer
effort.</P>
