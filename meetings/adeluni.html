<P>The next LinuxSA meeting will be held on the 17th of August, 7pm.
<B>Please note: the location of the meeting has changed (just for this
month).</B></P>

<P>The venue is:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Room 2060 (lecture theatre)<BR>
Computer Science<BR>
Level 2<BR>
Plaza Building<BR>
North Terrace Campus<BR>
The University of Adelaide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The simplest way to find this is to find the Security Office on the
plaza in the centre of the University.  The Security Office is clearly
marked on all the maps at the entrances to the University.  Walk past
BankSA and enter the Plaza Building (you should see some displays by
the architecture department), walk down the stairs to level 2 and
enter the computer science department doors.</P>

<P>The best place to park is Victoria Drive, then enter the uni
opposite the footbridge and walk up the stairs to the plaza.</P>

<P>Maps can be found at <A

<P>The Plaza Building has building code H9 and is at North Terrace
Campus Map coordinate G9.  It can only be entered from the western
side (where the arrow is on the map).</P>
