<B>Geoffrey D. Bennett</B> will be presenting a draft of the talk
which he will be presenting at <A
HREF="http://linux.conf.au/">LCA2006</A>: <B>A Case Study Using Perl
and Gtk2, or I Can't Believe It's Not A Softphone</B>.</P>

<P>Cisco System's 7940 and 7960 SIP IP Phones have a CLI accessible by
telnet for debugging and troubleshooting. Through this CLI, button
presses can be simulated with "test key" commands, so it is useful for
remote testing although a bit cumbersome.</P>

<P>The author has developed a tool which appears as a telnet client to
both the user and the phone, but in addition presents a graphical
interface mimicking the physical phone. When the buttons on the GUI
are clicked, the tool will enter appropriate "test key" commands in
the telnet session. By monitoring debugging output from the phone and
looking up entries in the BTXML card deck embedded in the phone's
software image, the information shown on the phone's LCD display is
also shown in the graphical interface. This essentially creates a
softphone mirror of the physical device sans audio.</P>

<P>The talk will look at how using Perl with Gtk2 made the development of
this GUI front-end to an existing CLI so easily possible (the first
version was completed within one day) along with some of the
more-interesting details of the implementation such as the use of
XML::Parser, non-blocking I/O, and the Gtk text widget.</P>

<P>After the meeting, please join us for pizza at San Giorgios (cnr.
Frome Street and Rundle Street in the city).</P>
