<P>
You will need the following components to connect the two Linux machines together using 10Base2 :
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>2 Ethernet network cards with a 10Base2 (Thin Ethernet) Interface which are supported by Linux.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>2 10Base2 T-Pieces - usually 1 is supplied with an Ethernet network card.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>1 piece of 10Base2 (RG-58) coaxial cable with BNC connectors on both end.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>2 10Base2 50 Ohm Terminators - these are connected to each end of the cable, as per the diagram.</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
The advantages of this method are as follows :
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Uses standard 10Base2 components which are fairly readily available - even Dick Smith carry them, however Dick Smith tend to be fairly expensive. Cable Assembly or Data Cabling companies should also be able to supply/make all the required components.</LI>
	<LI>In the corporate world, 10Base2 networking is being replaced - you may be able to pick up very cheap (and if you are lucky - free) 10Base2 network cards, cable, terminators etc.</LI>
	<LI>You can connect up to 30 devices (eg. PCs) to your 185 meter segment of 10Base2 cable.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The disadvantages of this method are as follows :
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>It is easy to loose the bits ie, the Terminators, T-Pieces etc.</LI>
	<LI>It can be very hard to find the fault if you have a faulty cable, T-Piece or terminator.</LI>
	<LI>To physically add a node from the network, you have to physically break the network, disrupting networking to all users on the LAN.</LI>
	<LI>You can remove a node from the network without physically breaking the segment, but you can only unplug it from the T-Piece; you cannot remove the T-Piece itself.</LI>
</UL>
