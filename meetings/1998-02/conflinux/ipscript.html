<H1>Configuring these settings the hardway - in the scripts</H1>
<HR>

<!-- Body Text Starts Here -->
<P>
The first way to configure the IP address, subnet mask and option default gateway address is in the system boot scripts.
</P>
<P>
The location of these scripts is Linux distribution dependent, but the are usually located somewhere under the <SAMP>/etc</SAMP> subdirectory.
</P>
<P>
For example, under the slackware distribution, they are located in the <SAMP>/etc/rc.d</SAMP> subdirectory.
</P>
<H2><SAMP>rc.inet1</SAMP></H2>
<P>
The <SAMP>rc.inet1</SAMP> file is the location of the commands which assign an IP address, subnetmask and default gateway to the Linux box.
</P>
<H3>Assigning an IP address and subnet mask to <SAMP>eth0</SAMP></H3>
<P>
Somewhere within the <SAMP>rc.inet1</SAMP> script will be the lines which assign an IP address and subnet mask to the <SAMP>eth0</SAMP> interface. 
</P>
<P>
These lines will look something like this :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SAMP>/sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.0.1.65 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.1.255</SAMP><BR>
<SAMP>/sbin/route add -net 10.0.1.0 dev eth0 netmask 255.255.255.0</SAMP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The first line assigns an IP address of 10.0.1.65 to the <SAMP>eth0</SAMP> interface. It also specifies the subnet mask (<SAMP>netmask 255.255.255.0</SAMP>) and also sets the interface broadcast value, which corresponds to the network and subnet number, with a host address of all binary 1s (<SAMP>broadcast 10.0.1.255</SAMP>).
</P>
<P>
The second line adds an entry into the route table, specifying that the 10.0.1.0 subnet is attached to the <SAMP>eth0</SAMP> device. Ensure that you assign the subnet number to the eth0 interface, by specifying the network and subnet, with a host address of all binary 0s (<SAMP>10.0.1.0</SAMP>).
</P>
<H3>Assigning the Default Gateway Address</H3>
<P>
Remember that you may not assign a Default Gateway address, if you have no gateways, or you are using PPP.
</P>
<P>
If you do need to assign a default gateway address, there will be a line in the <SAMP>rc.inet1</SAMP> file which looks like this :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SAMP>/sbin/route add default gw 10.0.1.1</SAMP>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This line assigns a default gateway address of 10.0.1.1. Specify the value of your default gateway instead of 10.0.1.1.
</P>
<H3>Applying these settings</H3>
<P>
After you have changed and saved the <SAMP>rc.inet1</SAMP> script, you need to apply these settings.
</P>
<P>
Although you could run the script manually, it is best to reboot the Linux box to ensure that the settings will be applied automatically, every time Linux is booted.
</P>
<H3>Checking the settings</H3>
<H4>IP Address and Subnet Mask</H4>
<P>
To check the IP address and subnet mask settings for your ethernet card issue the following command :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><KBD>/sbin/ifconfig eth0</KBD></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The values you are interested in are the <SAMP>inet addr</SAMP> which should correspond to the IP address you assigned, the <SAMP>Bcast</SAMP> address, which should correspond to the broadcast address you assigned, and finaly, the <SAMP>Mask</SAMP> value, which should correspond to the subnet mask you assigned.
</P>
<H4>Default Gateway</H4>
<P>
To check the default gateway value issue the following command :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><KBD>netstat -rn</KBD></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This command shows the route table of the Linux box, which is where the default gateway value is stored.
</P>
<P>
Look for the entry which has <SAMP>0.0.0.0</SAMP> in the destination column. Under the Gateway column of the same row, you should see the IP address you specified as the default gateway address.
</P>
<P>
You may also notice that you have an entry with a destination of the subnet you assigned to the <SAMP>eth0</SAMP> interface. This is the result of the second command (<SAMP>route</SAMP>) configured when setting the IP address of the <SAMP>eth0</SAMP> interface.
</P>
