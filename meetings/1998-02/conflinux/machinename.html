<H2>Host Names</H2>
<P>
People don't cope with remembering numbers very well. Particularly a large number of them (both people, and numbers).
</P>
<P>
TCP/IP based systems allow the association of names with IP addresses, to allow people to use the name of a machine, not its IP address.
</P>
<P>
These names are called <STRONG>Host names</STRONG>.
</P>
<P>
There are 3 ways of associating a name with an IP address :
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Add an entry into the /etc/hosts file</P></LI>
	<LI><P>Add an entry into the Domain Name Server</P></LI>
	<LI><P>Add an entry into the Sun Network Information Service (Yellowpages)</P></LI>
</UL>
<P>
This simplest way is to add an entry into the /etc/hosts file.
</P>
<H2>/etc/hosts</H2>
<P>
The /etc/hosts file is a text file containing mappings between IP addresses and host names.
</P>
<P>
Each line in the /etc/hosts file has the following format :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>&#60IP Address&#62 &#60hostname&#62</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
You can add as many entries as you like to this file, for both local and remote machines.
