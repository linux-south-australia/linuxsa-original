<!-- Body Text Starts Here -->
<P>
There are two ways of testing your TCP/IP connection.
</P>
<P>
The first test tests for another machine's presence on the IP network. This test uses the PING utility.
</P>
<P>
The second test tests whether you can use an application layer protocol to communcate with the remote machine.
</P>
<H2>Using PING</H2>
<P>
The <STRONG>P</STRONG>acket <STRONG>I</STRONG>nter<STRONG>N</STRONG>et <STRONG>G</STRONG>roper (PING) test shows whether a remote host is available on the network.
</P>
<P>
It works by sending an <STRONG>ICMP echo request</STRONG> packet to the specified IP address. If the selected machine is operating, it will receive the ICMP echo request, and return an <STRONG>ICMP echo response</STRONG> packet to the originating host. For each successful ICMP echo request and response pair, the orginating host will print a message indicating a successful ping.
</P>
<P>
To perform the PING test issue the following command :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>ping &#60IP Address&#62</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Alternatively, you can specify the <KBD>host name</KBD> instead of the <KBD>IP address</KBD> as long as you have made a corresponding entry in <STRONG>/etc/hosts</STRONG>.
</P>
<H3>Telnetting</H3>
<P>
Now that you have tested that the IP host is visable on the network using the PING test, you can now test your configuration using the application protocol TELNET.
</P>
<P>The TELNET protocol is a virtual terminal protocol. It sets up a connection to the remote machine and pretends to be a dumb terminal.
</P>
<P>
It is a good test because it shows that the other machine is communcating, and also supporting one of the most common application services available. 
</P>
<P>
To initiate a Telnet connection to the remote machine, issue the following command :
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>telnet &#60hostname&#62</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Alternatively, you could use the <KBD>IP address</KBD> instead of the <KBD>hostname</KBD>. 
</P>
<P>
After a short period, you should be presented with a banner showing the name of the remote machine, and a login prompt. At this login prompt, you can enter a user name of one of the users of the remote host. You then enter the password, and if it is correct, you will be logged in at a command line prompt, where you can issue any shell commands.
</P>
<P>
At this point, you have a fully networked Linux box. Any other services the remote machine is running, such as an FTP server or a Web server can now be accessed over the network.
</P>
