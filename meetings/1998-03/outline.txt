PART I: What is Security? (With a twist of Linux)

Introduction
	Goals
	Solutions for fulfilling the goals.

What is computer security?
	
Goals in Computer Security
	Integrity
		Level of trust
		Modified data
		Crackers editing, sending false email 
		Virii and Trojans
	Confidentiality
		Accessibility to authorised users
		Crackers view files
	Availability
		Resources available for authrorised users
		Denial of Service Attacks	
		Data availability - backups
		Access to systems when needed
		User data as a resource

Aspects for Security
	User Awareness
		Security Policies
	Physical Protection
		Lock your server up
		(Example NTFS access)
	Access Control
		Who can access what from where
	Auditing
		I've been hacked, what do I do
	Cryptography
		How to protect things
		Digital Signatures

Real World Computer Security Solutions
	Permissive vs Restrictive Security
	Defence in Depth - Firewalls
	Intrusion Detection Systems

PART II: Linux and Computer Security?
	
Introduction
	Areas to watch for security
	Examples of Linux and Computer Security
	Popularity of Linux in the Hacker scene.

Areas to watch on a Linux box
	File permissions
	Extra services
	setuid permissions
	poor encryption in areas
	
Linux as a target
	Common Unix Problems
		/etc/passwd (passwd encryption)
	Remote attacks
		DOS
			land/teardrop
			SYN flooding	**DEMO**
		Buffer overflows
			samba		**DEMO**
	False information
		SMTP			**DEMO**
		NFS			**DEMO**
	Local attacks
		buffer overflows	**DEMO**
		link following		**DEMO**
		password hacking (/etc/passwd)
		setuid use (XFree86)	**DEMO**

Linux from a dial-up view
	IRC means target
		SPAM relaying
	Are you live on the internet?
		Telnet into a Linux machine

------------------------------------------------------------------

PART III: What can I do?

Introduction
	Security starts with the User.
	System security only as strong as the weakest link.

Look at your system from the inside
	netstat -a
	rpcinfo -p localhost
	filesystem security
	Keep up to date with all patches (eg RH5 errata)
	Only install what you need, or install as needed.

Loot at your system from the outside
	portscan your system
	lock down you system (passwords at every step)

Defence in depth
	Add firewalling (ipfw_admin)
	protect sensitive files
		shadow password
	tcp_wrappers
	Use encyption
			
Monitor your system
	Watch you logs - messages and syslog
	Watch your logins - last

Educate the user
	Security Policies
	secure paths and secure locations  **DEMO**
	
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------

PART IV: Where to now?

Security mailing lists
	linux-security
	Full disclosure - like BUGTRAQ
	CERT/vendor announcements

Archives
	Exploit archives - rootshell

Journals
	Professional
	'Hacker' - Phrack

Link fests
	Gene Spafford's hotlist
