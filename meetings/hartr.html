<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Red Hat Linux Commercial Support Program</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Free Public Presentation by<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Robert Hart</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Manager, Support Services, Red Hat Software Inc.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Tuesday, 16th December, 1997 at 7:00pm</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Digital Equipment Corporation<BR>
2nd Floor, 139 Frome Street<BR>
Adelaide, South Australia</P>

<P>Robert is about to leave Australia to take up a permanent position
at Red Hat Software Inc. in North Carolina as Manager, Support
Services. This follows an extensive consulting contract from Robert's
company (InterWeft - http://www.interweft.com.au) with Red Hat
Software during 1997 developing the commercial support program.</P>

<P>Robert comes from an educational background, and this experience is
proving useful in developing the Red Hat Certification program. This
program is designed to provide one of the quality assurance
requirements for the devolved Red Hat commercial support program;
skilled and knowledgeable staff at the support partners.</P>

<P>Robert has been using Linux since kernel 0.99 and has used Red Hat
Linux since its first release in October 1994 (code named
``Halloween'').</P>

<P>Over the last seven years Linux has become an important operating
system in the commercial marketplace, in terms of features, stability,
speed and also of verified volume shipments. In the past, the lack of
formal Linux support arrangements has been cited as a reason for not
using Linux.  With the growing use of Linux in the corporate
environment, and the increasing demand for commercial support, Red Hat
Software has responded by developing a cooperative vendor-backed
support system for Red Hat Linux.</P>

<P>Robert will discuss the Red Hat Commercial Support program; how it
will work, and how it will be useful to companies requiring
vendor-backed support for Red Hat Linux, as well as its advantages to
the general Linux community.</P>

<P>LinuxSA is pleased to offer this lecture, and looks forward to the
participation of the local computing community.  LinuxSA would like to
thank Red Hat Software for sponsoring Robert's visit to South
Australia.</P>
