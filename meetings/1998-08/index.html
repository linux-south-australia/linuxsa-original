<H2><A NAME="when">When and Where</A></H2>

<P>The <STRONG>Second LinuxSA InstallFest</STRONG> is coming
soon!</P>

<P>The InstallFest will be held on <B>Saturday, 15th August 1998,
10am to 4pm</B> at <B>SA Water, 65 Broad St, Marden</B>.</P>

<P>Have a look at the map <A HREF="map.html">here</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="what">What is an InstallFest?</A></H2>

<P>If you want to run Linux but don't know how to install it, then an
InstallFest will help you.  You can bring along your computer and have
an experienced Linux user guide you through the installation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="there">What will be happening?</A></H2>

<P>We will have an area where people can have Linux installed, an area
where vendors can peddle their wares, and also an area where users can
show off the fun things that they do with Linux.  An ``Introduction to
Linux'' talk will be given at about 11am for people who are new to
Linux.</P>

<A NAME="registration"><H2>Registration</H2></A>

<P>If you plan to attend the InstallFest you are <B>strongly
recommended</B> to register.  There is no cost involved, but the
organisers need to have an idea of how many people will be turning
up.</P>

<P>You can register as either of the following:</P>

<DL>

<DT><B>User</B> (if you want to get Linux installed)<P>

<DD>Register on the web by filling out <A
HREF="/cgi-bin/register-user">this form</A>, or register via email by
sending a message to the address <A
HREF="mailto:register@linuxsa.org.au">register@linuxsa.org.au</A>
(check the web form for what details we would like to know).<P>

<DT><B>Helper</B> (if you want to help people get Linux installed)<P>

<DD>Register on the web by filling out <A
HREF="/cgi-bin/register-helper">this form</A>, or register via email
by sending a message to the address <A
HREF="mailto:register@linuxsa.org.au">register@linuxsa.org.au</A>
(check the web form for what details we would like to know).<P>

</DL>

<P>You can also register by calling Geoffrey D. Bennett on
8370&nbsp;3650.</P>

<P>If you are just curious about Linux and want to find out more, feel
free to just turn up; there's no need to register in this case.</P>

<H2><A NAME="versions">What versions will be installed?</A></H2>

<P>This depends on who ends up volunteering to help, and what they are
experienced with.  There will at least be a network server for
over-the-network installations, CDs for CD-ROM installations, and
there will also be CDs available for purchase.</P>

<H2><A NAME="hardware">What hardware is supported?</A></H2>

<P>Most modern PC hardware is supported, but any system above a 386SX
with 8&nbsp;MB of RAM and 100&nbsp;MB of hard drive space would be
suitable.  An ideal base level system is a 486DX with 16&nbsp;MB of
RAM and 300&nbsp;MB of disk space.</P>

<P>If you have an supported Ethernet network card you will be able to
do a network install.  If you have a supported SCSI or IDE CD-ROM you
will be able to do a CD-ROM install.</P>

<P>To check that your hardware is likely to be supported for any
distribution check out the <A
HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/intel/rh51-hardware-intel.html">Red
Hat Linux Hardware Compatibility list</A>.  Or if your hardware is not
on that list try a web search using the manufacturer or product
name/number and "linux" as keywords.</P>

<P>Some laptops are supported, check out the <A
HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/">Linux
Laptop Home Page</A> for a list of a number of laptops that have been
attempted to be used with Linux.</P>

<P>Very old hardware or brand new <EM>bleeding edge</EM> hardware may
have problems with compatibility with Linux.</P>

<P>SPARC, UltraSPARC or Alpha-AXP based systems are also welcome,
although contact <A
HREF="mailto:organisers@linuxsa.org.au">organisers@linuxsa.org.au</A>
prior to the InstallFest to ensure that there will be a distribution
suitable for your computer available.</P>

<H2><A NAME="bring">What should I bring?</A></H2>

<P>Bring enough hardware to have your system operating
<STRONG>independently</STRONG> from other systems.  That is, bring at
least the following to the InstallFest:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The computer itself
  <LI>Monitor
  <LI>Mouse
  <LI>Keyboard
  <LI>Power board and power cables
  <LI>Any manuals for your hardware (especially for your monitor)
  <LI>CD-ROM drive (if any)
  <LI>Network Card (if any)
  <LI>Two or more freshly formatted floppies
</UL>

<P>It would also be useful if you brought the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A notepad and pen
  <LI>Good Humour.  This is meant to be Fun.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="before">What should I do before the InstallFest?</A></H2>

<P>Of course everyone has backups... and since you will be having a
new OS installed on your system, <STRONG>BACKUP ANY DATA THAT YOU
CARE ABOUT</STRONG>.  Although the organisers and helpers will make
every effort to ensure that you will not lose any data, there is a
slight possibility that data loss will occur.  It is your
responsibility to back up your data before arriving at the meeting;
the organisers and helpers cannot take any responsibility for your
system.</P>

<P>If you are an experienced PC user and are confident with
repartitioning, try to ensure that there is enough space to create an
extra couple of partitions to install Linux into.  The "fips" utility
located <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.netcraft.com.au/pub/redhat/redhat-5.1/i386/dosutils/fips15c/fips15c">here</A>
may be helpful in shrinking a DOS partition with having to delete it.
Read the readme.1st file first.</P>

<P>If you are no experience repartitioning your computer, just ensure
that the drive has been checked thoroughly by a disk checking utility
such as SCANDISK or CHKDSK.  Also, run a defragmenter such as DEFRAG
or SPEEDISK to ensure that all your data is at the beginning of the
disk.</P>

<A NAME="info"><H2>Where do I go for more information?</H2></A>

<A NAME="promotion"><H2>Promoting the InstallFest</H2></A>

<P>Please tell anyone you know who may be interested in using Linux.
We'd like to make this event as big as possible!</P>

<P>To assist in your promotions, we have an <A HREF="flyer.html">HTML
flyer</A> you can print out and hand around/place in conspicuous
places.  There is also a <A HREF="flyer.ps">Postscript</A> version.
