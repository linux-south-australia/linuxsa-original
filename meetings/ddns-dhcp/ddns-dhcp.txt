Using Dynamic DNS and DHCP
==========================


o What is DNS?
  - Domain Name Service.
  - Used to lookup IP's from names and vice versa.
  - Basically a big distributed database.
  - Servers are authorative over small areas with root nodes to tie
    things together.
  - Most common DNS server called BIND - Berkeley Internet Name
    Daemon.

o What is DHCP?
  - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
  - Clients send out requests (with optional information)
  - Server then assigns an IP and may or may not use the information.
    in the request.
  - Can only be one central server or chaos will result!
  - Open source implementations - ISC (maintainers of BIND)
				- WIDE (.ja possibly out of date)

o What about dynamic DNS?
  - As the name implies - dynamically change name records.
  - Dynamic update protocol described in RFC 2136.
  - Security important (secure key exchange etc).
  - Updates can be done remotely in a standard manner. (nsupdate/GnuDIP)

o Why bother?
  - Good for roaming users.
  - Convenient for the DNS admin.
  - Once off implementation cost.
  - Looks cool!
  

o How do they work together?
  - Client sends request to server for IP.
  - DHCP server checks if it is OK to grant an IP.
  - DHCP send request to DNS server to change DNS records.
  - DNS server propagates changes to secondaries.
  - Note that the DHCP and DNS server share a private key.

o Problems
  - DDNS eats your nicely formatted zone files.
  - I've crashed BIND 8 with DDNS.
  - Fairly new code.
