- What is SSL
  - Secure Socket Layer
  - "Secure" Web Server
  - Commonly used to encrypt HTTP communications
    (https://... on default port 443 instead of http://...)
    but also can used for telnet, POP, etc.
  - Client can be sure who they are talking to
  - Less common: server can be sure who they are talking to

- How it works (more crypto stuff)
  - Described basics of symmetric/asymmetric cryptography last month
    - Symmetric: one key (private) used to both encrypt and decrypt
    - Asymmetric: one key (public) used to encrypt and another (private) to
      decrypt

  - Email examples:
    - Signing a message
      - Hashing algorithms
    - Signing a key

  - Web examples:
    - Signing a key

- mod_ssl, Apache-SSL
  http://www.openssl.org/
  http://www.modssl.org/

- Installing mod_ssl
  - Included with Red Hat 7.0
  - http://www.megaloman.com/~hany/RPM/mod_ssl.html

- Generating a public/private key pair:
  - openssl genrsa 1024 > www.domain.com.key
  - or with a passphrase: openssl genrsa -des3 1024 > www.domain.com.key

- Removing a passphrase from a key:
  - openssl rsa -in in.key -out out.key

- Creating a certificate request:
  - openssl req -new -key www.domain.com.key -out www.domain.com.csr

- Creating a temporary self-signed certificate:
  - openssl x509 -req -days 30 -in www.domain.com.csr \
    -signkey www.domain.com.key -out www.domain.com.crt 

- Viewing a key/crt/csr information:
  - openssl asn1parse < in-file

- Setting up Apache:
  - Include the mod_ssl module by appending to the LoadModule list:
    LoadModule ssl_module modules/libssl.so

  - And to the AddModule list:
    AddModule mod_ssl.c

  - Listen to the SSL port:
    Listen 80
    Listen 443

  - Set up the virtual host (must be IP-based):

<VirtualHost _default_:443>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@netcraft.com.au
  DocumentRoot /home/httpd/html
  ServerName www.netcraft.com.au

  SSLEngine on
  SSLCertificateFile    /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/www.netcraft.com.au.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.key/www.netcraft.com.au.key
</VirtualHost>

  - Default certificate & key names:
    /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.crt/server.crt
    /etc/httpd/conf/ssl.key/server.key

  - Restart Apache (not reload or graceful reload)

  - Testing with Netscape

- Getting a certificate signed:
  - www.verisign.com
  - www.thawte.com
