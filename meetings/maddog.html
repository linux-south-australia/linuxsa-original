Jon ``maddog'' Hall</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>UNIX Group Senior Manager, Digital Equipment
Corporation</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>LinuxSA is pleased to welcome maddog to Adelaide</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Tuesday, 16th September, 1997 at 7:00pm</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>Digital Equipment Corporation<BR>
2nd Floor, 139 Frome Street<BR>
Adelaide, South Australia</P>

<P>Jon "maddog" Hall is the principal architect of Digital 
Equipment Corporation's UNIX strategy. He will be continuing 
the theme of his keynote speech at the recent AUUG 
conference in Brisbane. Jon has been in the UNIX group for 
fifteen years as an engineer, Product Manager and Marketing 
Manager. Prior to Digital, Jon was a Senior Systems 
Administrator in Bell Laboratories' UNIX group, so he has 
been programming and using UNIX for over 19 years.</P>

<P>In addition to Jon's work with Digital UNIX, Jon is also 
Executive Director of Linux International, a non-profit 
organization dedicated to promoting the use of Linux, a 
freely distributable re-implementation of the UNIX operating 
system. Digital was the first system vendor to join Linux 
International, and is a Corporate Sponsoring Member. Jon is 
directly responsible for the port of Linux to the Alpha 
processor.</P>

<P>Over the last seven years Linux has become an important 
operating system in the commercial marketplace, in terms of 
features, stability, speed and also of verified volume 
shipments. While it has been certified as standard UNIX by 
the X/Open body, Linux is much more, having unequalled 
integration tools. Linux can run programs written for many 
other operating systems, network with most kinds of 
computers, and run on most kinds of hardware.</P>
