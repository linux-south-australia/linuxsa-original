<H3><A NAME="icecast">IceCast</H3>
IceCast is a server that will stream mp3's to clients, just like a shoutcast server will (IceCast was actually written to be a free 'equivilent' of a shoutcast server for Linux). The icecast software only came in source code, but successfully compiled with only a "./configure ; make". The IceCast executable only sends the data to clients, but the source comes with software that can send MP3s to the server. There is software to send already encoded MP3's to the server and there is software to send music coming from the soundcard to an encoder, which in turn can be sent to the server, so 'live' transmissions are possible. Another useful feature is it's ability to list itself in several MP3 'radio' directories, such as yp.shoutcast.com and IceCast's own directory.

<H3><A NAME="taggers">id3tag and freezetag</A></H3>
id3tag and freezetag are both software to edit the 'tag' information on a MP3 file. MP3's, while being headerless, can contain 'tags' which tells software (and in turn the listener) about the song. Information that tags can contain include artist, song, album, year, comments, genre and some others.

<H3><A NAME="ripperx">ripperX</A></H3>
RipperX is simply a frontend to CD 'rippers' and MP3 encoders. the preset settings use cdparanoia to rip the CD, and a program who's executable is called 'encode' to encode the MP3s. RipperX also supports CDDB (as well as manual renaming of tracks), so you do not need to rename the final MP3 after it is encoded.
