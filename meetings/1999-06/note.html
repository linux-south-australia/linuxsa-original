<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">I'd firstly like to thank everyone who was at the speech and to those who helped me with the many questions I didn't have answers to :)

<P>If you need to contact me (the person who spoke), I'm <A HREF="mailto:andy@zivkotech.net.au">Andy Zivkovic andy@zivkotech.net.au</A>. If you have any questions about anything presented, or anything MP3 related, please feel free to mail me, or the mailing list.

<P>All the programs I showed, I found at <A HREF="http://www.ozbytes.net.au">OzBytes'</A> <A HREF="http://linuxberg.ozbytes.net.au">Linuxberg</A> mirror.

<P>I don't know if there's a MP3 howto (or anything similar, such as a FAQ), so if the demand is there, I can extend this speech to cover more. For a while (maybe forever if it's useful), I'll keep a mirror (well, it'll actually be the original) at <A HREF="http://www.zivkotech.net.au/~andy/linuxsa/mp3s">http://www.zivkotech.net.au/~andy/linuxsa/mp3s</A>, which will also contain corrections and additions. If you're reading this long after the 15th of June, 1999, the link may not be valid any longer, sorry.

<P>Thanks again to everyone and thanks to the people who make all the meetings (and mailing list) possible!
